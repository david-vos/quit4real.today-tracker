# Quit4Real.today
This project is the backend for http://Quit4Real.today
The goal is simple. Track a user to see *If* they play a game they said they would not.

# Suggestions
If you have any suggestions dont be scared to create an issue/PR. Ill be looking around at other systems to support in a bit.
Right now steam will be the main priority but I would like riot ( but there api keys suck ) and Blizzard. I have yet to look into Ubisoft and Xbox :eyes:

# Setup
```bash
cp config/.example.config.go config/config.go
go build -v
go run quit4real.today
```

# VERY BETA
This project is currently stil a WIP.
Everything is currently subject to change. That includes the data design and reponse types
Right now I am bussy with the BE and will soon start working on the FE afther at least steam is added.

# Help me
If you want to help me just create a issue or PR. Dont be shy I dont bite
